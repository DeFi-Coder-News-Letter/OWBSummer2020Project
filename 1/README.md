# NBA Top Shot Autographs

Proof of concept to allow NBA Top Shot moments to be autographed

- Autographs are backedüíØ% on-chain
- Autographs maintain the author address for authenticity
- Autographs can be added to any moment by anyone, but only can be removed by moment owner
- This project will be extended to allow personalization of any NFT, via autographs or any other content (tickets, audio, images, etc.)

## Running proof of concept locally

1. Start Flow emulator
1. Deploy NonFungibleToken contract to account 1 (0x01cf0e2f2f715450)
1. Deploy Autograph contract to account 3 (0xf3fcd2c1a78f5eee)
1. Deploy TopShot contract (modified for extensibility) to account 2 (0x179b6b1cb6755e31)
1. Run `npm install` to install UI package dependencies
1. Run `npm run dev:wallet` to run fcl wallet
1. Run `npm run serve` in a separate terminal to start app
1. Open app at [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/)
1. Login with any credentials (remember for later) to initialize test user (0xe03daebed8ca0615)
1. Execute init_data transaction as TopShotAdmin (0x179b6b1cb6755e31) to initialize moments for test user
1. Refresh app and login as test user using the same credentials used to initialize to see moments
1. Enjoy adding autographs to moments, backed COMPLETELY on-chain!
