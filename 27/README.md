# CertaFox - The future of professional certifications

## Summary
CertaFox is a service that makes it easy to create and share certificates. With CertaFox you can be sure that a certificate is valid without going through the exhaustive work of checking references.

## Limitations
The application currently has dummy data and some contracts built. We did not have enough time to build the integration between the contracts and the UI.

## Potential
The contracts are pretty narrow in scope today, they essentially make it easy for everyone to create certificates as NFTs and that's it. Future features could make for more complex certificates where:
- Certificates can expire
- Certificates can only be transferred once and/or only have one owner
- Certificates can be signed by multiple addresses
- Certificates can hold sub certificates
